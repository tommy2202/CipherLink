# Security Notes (Skeleton)

This section will document UniversalDrop's security model, threat assumptions,
and controls. It is intentionally minimal for FEATURE 1A.

Planned topics:

- End-to-end encryption boundaries
- Receiver approval flows
- Capability token scopes and TTLs
- Storage lifecycle and retention
- Logging and redaction rules
